# Learning Programming through Python

The objective of this repository is to create programs for the MIT 60001.600 class of 
intro to Python. The codes created for various assignments will be saved here and it will also 
be used as a good excuse to learn version control using git/github. Code from any other courses taken as programming training may or may not be added to this repository.
